# factorio-stationmaker - 2024 JULY

Factorio Station Maker by Dogmai
- DogmaiSEA || Dogmai - South East Asia (Servers)

A collection of commonly used blueprints that can be used on any type of train, for example; 1-2, 2-4, 1-8, 3-8-3, or whatever monstrosity you can imagine, such as 23-5-83-9-238-59.

## The Concept

The idea behind this book is to have a simple and easy to use blueprint book that can help both new and veteran Factorio players - consider it a "quality of life" blueprint book.

Over the past few years, I have spent a great deal of time on public Factorio servers, often hopping from server to server to help new players in the early to mid-game, as my Gen 1 i7 computer struggles with Factorio in the end-game.

I have witness firsthand the confusion by new players in attempting to create their own train station designs that they need that were not included in the end-game blueprint book that they had downloaded.

This issue was replaying in my mind for a while; what if we split station design into pre-built segments that could be arranged like a simple jigsaw puzzle, regardless of train length or setup.

This blueprint book is the realisation of my attempt to help fix this issue.

## Terminology Clarifications


### L, C and A

When you see people talk about trains, they commonly use terminology such as: L-C-C or L-C-C-C-C-L or L-A-A-A-A-A-A-A;

In this case, this terminology means;

- L =  Locomotive
- C = Cargo/Fluid Wagon
- A = Artillery Wagon


### X-X-X

When you see people talk about trains, they also use such terminology as: 1-4, 1-4-1, 2-8-2, 3-8-3 etc.

In this case, this terminology means;

- 1-4 means 1 Front Facing Locomotive followed by 4 Wagons
- 1-4-1 means 1 Front Facing Locomotive, 4 Wagons and 1 Rear Facing Locomotive
- 2-8-2 means 2 Front Facing Locomotives, 4 Wagons and 2 Rear Facing Locomotives
- 3-8-3 means 3 Front Facing Locomotives, 4 Wagons and 3 Rear Facing Locomotives

As a rule of thumb, any train with "3" individual numbers written in that style can travel in both directions, otherwise known as a double-headed (DH) train, or a bi-directional (BI or BIDIR) train.


### BIDIR, LHD and RHD

- BIDIR - Bi-Directional Rail

Bi-Directional trains are trains that can travel in both directions, however this can also be applied to single rails, and bi-directional rails allow for travel in both directions, this type of rail design is especially good for long runs to mining outposts that only a single train will travel on.

- LHD - Left Hand Drive Rail

LHD means Left-Hand Drive, and it used when referencing two tracks that run parallel to each other, with each one only running in a single direction.

It is the side of the road that Great Britain, Japan and Australia drive on.

If looking at two train tracks that run up and down, the one on the left will be heading up, and the one on the right heading down.

- RHD - Right Hand Drive Rail

RHD means Left-Hand Drive, and it used when referencing two tracks that run parallel to each other, with each one only running in a single direction.

It is the side of the road that the USA, China and most of the world drives on.

If looking at two train tracks that run up and down, the one on the right will be heading up, and the one on the left heading down.


### Mainline and Spur

- Mainline

The mainline is the "main" track line that other lines can "spur" off of, usually these are run in pairs, either in LHD or RHD configurations.

- Spur

A spur is a line that splits off from the mainline with a single purpose, such as a mining outpost.

## LHD vs RHD vs BIDIR

LHD is the superior choice for trains in Factorio as it allows the rail signal placement to be placed on the inside of the train track, saving two tiles of space compared to commonly used RHD designs, it is often seen as "neater" and more "functional" and "efficient".

BIDIR is the superior choice for spurs to mining outposts from the mainline.

LHD is also funnily enough the superior choice for cars, as 90% of people are right handed, and their dominate hand should remaining on the steering wheel at all times, and not the gear shifter in manual cars, but too late to fix that now.

## Understanding Trains and Train Station Alignment

In Factorio, the individual segments (locomotive, cargo wagon and fluid wagon) of trains are 6 units long, however, there is a coupling between each segment with a length of 1, this results in train segments actually being 7 units long, with only the very last segment being 6.

Odd numbers added together will alternate been odd and even answers for every additional number added to the equation, for example 7 x 1 = 7, 7 x 2 = 14, 7 x 3 = 21, 7 x 4 = 28 etc, this outputted number is the "starting point" for your loaders or unloaders.

It is because of this alternation between odd and even numbers, that your starting point will be out by one if you add an additional locomotive to the front of your train, or if you reverse the direction of a train station without moving the loaders.

As such, if you wish to expand your train station designs later, you have to choose whether you wish to have an odd or an even number of locomotives at the front of the train, anything trailing behind the wagons doesn't matter.

For example, 1-4 trains can be expanded to 3-8 trains, 3-8-3 trains, or 5-16 trains, but never 2-4, 2-8 or 2-8-2 trains.

2-4 trains can be expanded into 2-8, 2-8-2 or 4-16-4 trains, but never 3-8, 3-16 or 5-16 trains.

## Blueprint Book Explanation

### Ruler

The Ruler is an idea I came up with to help players align their blueprints properly.

The Default Station is named with the "Dot" signal and coloured white, so you don't accidentally call a train whilst the station is being built and unload copper ore onto your iron ore line for example.

Trust me, we have all done that at least once, and it is really not fun trying to clean up.

You place it down as a ghost, and then delete what you don't need.

Align the blueprints, (power pole aligns with the combinator) based on whether you use 1, 2 or 3 locomotives in front of your trains); and if you use anything larger than this, you already have the knowledge of what to do.

It also marks the end point for the most commonly used trains; 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, 1-8, 2-8 and 3-8.


### Read Me's

I have included several read me's in the Blueprint Book in order to maintain a player's immersion within the game, and without needing to look up a website for commonly asked questions.


### Fluid Loader and Unloader

Included is a tileable Fluid loader and unloader that will self-balance (given a little bit of time) and is 100% compatible with Factorio 2.X.

In fact, I believe a design similar to this one will become the standard or "pick of choice" for most Factorio players in the expansion.


### Compact 4x Train Unloader and Example

This is the pride and joy of my train station design, the dream was simple; I wanted my trains to all pull into my factory, parked next to each other, and have it look like a "real" train station.

The included example is an example of what can be done with this design, using 8-8 Inline Through-put Unlimited Lane Balancers of my own design, based on Raynquist's 8-8 TU.

This one train station is enough to run a 1k SPM base without any other stations needed (if using coal liquefaction), otherwise an oil unloaded would be needed.


### Loaders and Unloaders

Included in this Blueprint Book are the best loading and unloading designs I could either come up with on my own, or as were designed by other players.

As loading and unloading is such an integral part of the game, chances are multiple people have came up with the same designs before anyone ever shared anything on the internet.

Unless you get into really complicated and unique train station designs, such as the example of my own included, chances are someone has done it before.

We are all human, we all live on the same planet, let's build each other up, and help each other for a better tomorrow.
